# Analysis

This folder contains tools and resources for analyzing the performance and outcomes of the heuristics implemented in the PTL system. It is structured into three main subdirectories, each serving a distinct purpose in the analysis process.

## Structure

### 1. `comparison_table`
This subdirectory focuses on generating and maintaining comparison tables that summarize the performance of different heuristics. Key functionalities include:
- Tabulating results for easy comparison between methods.
- Highlighting key metrics such as runtime, accuracy, or solution quality.

### 2. `find_bks`
The `find_bks` (Best Known Solutions) directory is responsible for:
- Identifying and storing the best-known solutions for various instances of the problem.
- Providing reference points to evaluate the performance of heuristics against these optimal or near-optimal solutions.

### 3. `statistics`
This subdirectory contains scripts and resources for:
- Performing statistical analysis on the results generated by the heuristics.
- Computing metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and other relevant statistical measures.
- Supporting hypothesis testing and deeper insights into heuristic performance.

## Purpose

The `analysis` folder is designed to support researchers and developers in:
1. Evaluating the effectiveness of implemented heuristics.
2. Comparing different methods to determine the most suitable approach.
3. Understanding the statistical properties of the results.

## How to Use

1. **Run your heuristic algorithms** to generate results.
2. Place the data into the appropriate subdirectory:
   - Use `comparison_table` for organizing results into tables.
   - Use `find_bks` to update or reference best-known solutions.
   - Use `statistics` for performing detailed analysis.
3. Follow the instructions or scripts within each subdirectory to process and analyze the data.

## Contribution

If you have suggestions or improvements for any aspect of the analysis process, feel free to contribute:
- Submit a pull request with your changes.
- Open an issue to discuss potential enhancements.

## Notes

- Ensure all required Python libraries are installed as per the repository's `requirements.txt` file.
- Check each subdirectory for specific documentation or instructions.
